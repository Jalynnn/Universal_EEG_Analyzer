# Universal_EEG_Analyzer

MNE-Python for frequency analysis (and eventually ERP analysis).

# Set Up

Create a folder for raw data.

The current working file is "EEG_Analysis_MNE_Add_Gamma2.ipynb".

To run the code, I use anaconda now with pip imports. The install commands available in the .ipynb file.

# EEG_Analysis_MNE_Add_Gamma.ipynb

Data is currently being pulled from the "Dataset" folder and outputs in the "GammaResult2" folders.

The All_Ratios_Summary.csv is your friend summarizing both ratios used in the first study! With the exception for the gamma results
