# Universal_EEG_Analyzer

MNE-Python for frequency analysis (and eventually ERP analysis).

# Set Up

Create a folder for raw data.

The current working file is "EEG_Analysis_MNE_Add_Gamma.ipynb" but I would like to break it out of one big class in the "eeg_analysis.ipynb" file.

To run the code, I use anaconda now with pip imports. The install commands available in the .ipynb file.

# EEG_Analysis_MNE_Add_Gamma.ipynb

Data is currently being pulled from the "Dataset" folder and outputs in the "GammaResults" folders.

"GammaResults" consists of the outputs that were used in the study analysis.

# eeg_analysis.ipynb

Data is currently being pulled from the "Raw" folder and outputs in the "Results" folders.

"Results" consists of the outputs that should match "GammaResults" but don't. It's a work in progress. Again, I am just trying to get the code out of the one big class.

# EEG_Analysis_MNE_Add_Gamma_2.ipynb

I'm gonna casually restart. See what happens. Especially since it's been a minute since I looked at this last.
